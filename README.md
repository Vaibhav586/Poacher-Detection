# Poacher Detection

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system to detect poachers in wildlife areas using thermal imaging and IoT devices. The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to identify and classify potential threats, enabling faster response times for conservation efforts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art AI and machine learning techniques to protect wildlife from poaching. By analyzing real-time data from thermal imaging cameras, the system can detect unusual human activity that might indicate poaching.

## Key Features

- **Thermal Imaging Analysis**: Uses thermal imaging to detect heat signatures from humans and animals.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A CNN model trained on a large dataset to classify thermal images.
- **IoT Integration**: The system is designed to be deployed in real-time with IoT sensors, allowing continuous monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation)
- **IoT Integration**: (List any sensors or devices used, such as thermal cameras, motion sensors, etc.)
- **Backend**: Flask API for model deployment (if applicable)
- **Frontend**: (If applicable, mention React or any other framework for the UI)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav586/Poacher-Detection.git
cd Poacher-Detection

Set Up the Environment
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate

Ensure you have the pretrained model files in the appropriate directory. (Provide more specific instructions here based on your implementation.)

# Usage
Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the following commands to start the application:

Train the Model:
If you have the training data, you can train the CNN model by running:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the Detection System: After training, you can run the system to detect poachers:

bash
Copy code
python detect_poachers.py
